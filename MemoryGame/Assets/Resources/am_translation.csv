I am an old man already. ,我已经老了。,난 벌써 노인이다.,ฉันอายุมากแล้ว
I live alone.,我自己一个人住。,난 혼자 산다.,ฉันอยู่คนเดียว
"Some time ago, my doctor told me that I have Alzheimer's disease. Apparently, it makes you forget things.",不久前，医生跟我说我得了“阿尔茨海默症”。很显然，这会让人忘记一些事情。,얼마전에 의사가 나에게 치매가 있다고 했다. 기억을 잃게 한다고 한다.,เมื่อไม่นานมานี้ คุณหมอบอกให้ฉันว่า ฉันเป็นโรคอัลไซเมอร์ ซึ่งมักจะทำให้ฉันลืมสี่งต่างๆ
"I don’t have trouble living daily, though. ",我日常生活倒是没有什么困难。,하지만 난 매일을 사는데 문제는 없다.,ฉันไม่มีปัญหาในการชีวิดประจำวัน
I live a very simple life. ,毕竟，我的生活很简单。,난 매우 단순한 삶을 산다.,ฉันมีชีวิตที่เรียบง่าย
"Sometimes I can’t sleep, so I take two sleeping pills before I go to bed. And then, I would dream. And dream some more.",睡不着的时候，我就在睡觉前吃两片安眠药。然后，我就会做梦。然后做更多的梦。,때때로 나는 잠이 오지 않아서 수면제 두 알을 먹고 잠에 든다. 그리고 나는 꿈을 꾼다. 또 꿈을 꾼다.,เมื่อฉันนอนไม่หลับ ฉันจะกินยานอนหลับสองเม็ดก่อนนอน แล้วฉันก็จะฝันแล้วฝันอีก
I don’t want to forget things. ,我不想忘记。,잊어버리고 싶지 않다.,ฉันไม่อยากลืม
...time for bed.,...该睡了。,...잠에 들 시간이다.,ต้องนอนแล้ว
...sir? Are you lost?,...老先生？你迷路了吗？,"...할아버지, 길을 잃으셨나요?",คุณตา หลงทางหรือเปล่าคะ
Would you want me to walk you home?,我把你送回家吧？,제가 집에 바래다 드릴까요?,หนูจะส่งคุณตาไปส่งบ้านนะ
Where do you live? ,你住在哪里呀？,어디 사세요?,คุณตาพักอยู่ที่ไหนคะ
...You don't remember?,...你不记得了？,...기억이 안 나신다고요?,คุณตาจำไม่ได้แล้วหรอคะ
"Hey, wait, where are you going?",等等，要去哪儿啊？,"저기, 잠깐만요, 어디 가세요?",เดี๋ยวก่อน จะไปไหนคะ
Here we are. ,我们到啦。,도착했네.,เรามาถึงแล้วค่ะ
"Alright sir, take care. Don't go wander off like that again!",老先生，保重身体。别再在外面乱走了！,"알겠습니다, 어르신. 몸 조심하세요. 또 밖에 돌아다니지 마시고요!",คุณตา ดูแลตัวเองด้วยนะคะ อย่าเดินออกมาคนเดียวอีกนะ
"Ok, bye.",好，再见。,"그래, 잘 가게.",ลาก่อน สวัสดีค่ะ

"Alzheimer’s: Memories is a point-and-click adventure that tells the story of an old man diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease. In the game, you will re-experience moments of the life of the old man, and help him find out about his own past.",,"치매의: 기억들은 치매 진단을 받은 노인의 이야기를 들려주는 포인트-클릭 모험 게임입니다. 게임에서 여러분들은 노인의 삶의 순간들을 재경험하고, 노인이 자신의 과거에 대해 알아내는 것을 도울 것입니다.",

"You are having trouble remembering; things like what you ate for breakfast, where you put the car key, or who are the people shown in the photos on your desk. Still, those will prove to be only minor problems. After all, you live a very simple life during the day.",,"기억하는게 어렵다; 아침으로 무엇을 먹었는지, 차키를 어디에다가 두었는지, 책상 위 사진 속 사람들은 누구인지. 그래도 이건 작은 문제일 뿐이다. 어차피 낮시간 동안에는 단순한 삶을 산다.",
"It is the night time that is more difficult. In dreams, one has to make sense. Where are you? What are those things you see? Why does everything feel familiar, but also strange?",,밤은 어렵다. 꿈에서는 알아야 한다. 나는 어디인가? 저기 보이는 것들은 무엇인가? 왜 모든 것이 친숙하면서도 낯선가?,
Dreams are not simple. Dreams are complicated… Dreams are forgotten bits of your past clinging on to you. Dreams are the only treasure you’ll ever really possess.,,꿈은 간단하지 않다. 꿈은 복잡하다. 꿈 속에서는 잃어버린 과거조각들이 나에게 찾아와 엉겨붙는다. 꿈은 내가 온전히 소유할 수 있는 유일한 보물이다.  ,

"1. [overall] the translation of Alzheimer's (Alzheimer's disease). 1) to distinguish between dementia(치매) and Alzheimer's disease(알츠하이머병); 2) the proper use of ""치매"" regarding its sociolinguistic meanings",,,
"2. [2] comapred with the Chinese version it means ""Alzheimer's: Guard(수호(守護))"", may need to further concern the use of ""memories""",,,
